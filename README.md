# About Brain Games
Brain games are five games that challenge your math skills: calculation, finding patterns, finding the greatest common divisor, understanding the parity and primality of a number.

## Requirements
Python >= 3.12, uv >= 0.6.8, make 

## Installation
To install Brain games follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/oshwa364/python-project-49.git
   ```
2. Naviagte to the project directory:
   ```bash
    cd python-project-49
    ```
3. Run the installation script with make:
   ```bash
   make install
   make build
   make package-install
   ```

## How to play
Now you have five games:
1. brain-calc, where you need to add, subtract or multiply two numbers
2. brain-even, where you need to decide whether number is even
3. brain-gcd, where you need to find the greatest common divisor
4. brain-progression, where you need to compute missing number
5. brain-prime, where you need to bodly guess whether a number has divisors

   To run, for example, brain-calc use this command:
   ```bash
   brain-calc
   ```

## Uninstallation
To uninstall Brain games run the following commands:

1. Naviagte to the project directory:
   ```bash
    cd python-project-49
    ```
2. Run the uninstallation script:
    ```bash
    make uninstall
    ```
